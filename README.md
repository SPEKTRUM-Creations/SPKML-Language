# SPKML-Language
You are invited to join this project in developing spkml as a language with the languages Starting point being a 15-year-old concept introduced in my book called CodeBase (by Chris Johnson/Christopher Johnson) that is being developed For real to be an answer to The creation of a median language That has the broad scope to be utilized at the network level as well as the system and user levels based on an XHTML Focused language which indeed can be interpreted or compiled within itself by itself utilizing a javascript core and encapsulating within single files multiple pages as well as the styling in CSS or even through the body of the SPKML tag set which is an extended superset of the HTML Current Living Standard.  In a way this is a very large project for a sole-developer to attack considering the broad scope and audacity to attempt to what seems to be and ego fueled rewrite but I feel it's necessary with the inclusion of machine learning and AI Featured in Present and future versions of core EMCA JavaScript making an adaptation For the purpose of potential replacement or at least And ability to work in tandem with current living standards for HTML moving forward more below


This will and someways be a fork not just HTML current living standard specifications while adapting that code as a super-set that is then extended to include empires through natural language processing and AI tied to machine learning To process and parse the meaning and intention behind what would currently be unreadable and unparsed tags Making it much easier to write from scratch custom XML/XHTML and have it processed with the ability to enclose and encapsulate the CSS and JavaScript within And as expected To include them from dependencies from outside sources Locally or remotely such as a CDN which would be utilized in a different way by requiring Perhaps a rewrite or not of core EMCA javascript as a Minimized an optimized Version of code that takes the base requirements for running basic JavaScript functions and dividing up and separating into categories not just for the HTML code but also for the JavaScript and CSS levels of no less than three segments starting with network, system and user spaces Set a different security levels with proper permissions by default set with no less than three Levels of security for each of the zones mentioned which would include similar permissions as those set on a UNIX/Linux-based operating system essentially sandboxing where necessary.  The super set of code utilized from the current working standard will potentially include some if not all deprecated tags for backwards compatibility with HTML5 all the way back to early versions of html given the proper doctype header definitions, in this case SPKML will be also able to be compiled not just interpreted as a language and by using two levels of compression possible, you can first minimize and encapsulate the parent document(s) as well as all dependencies for the index page And secondly using a console Based Script utilizing a javascript Conversion/Compression/encryption script, it is Suggested that UTF 32 or higher be utilized and a cipher replacement utilizing a method where each tag is given a certain character to Officially define not just each tag but each set of words were each word and operator in a way to minimize an obscufate The code into a machine readable format as well as encapsulate within that all dependencies into a single file which can then be read similarly to a web archive or an MHTML file or as I understand it a bundled HTML file with its own dependencies in a compressed file Generated by a program like webpack or similar program scripts. (I haven't reached the point where I've actually compiled a a bundled HTML package with its dependencies mainly because of lack of time to get to that point)

Note: I apologize for any misspellings or typos are usually use Dictation on my phone to process my thoughts quickly and therefore sometimes you will notice I had capitalization or the lack of punctuation.  Please forgive me moving forward and I will continue to try to edit as I go but I think we all know what it's like to be in a train of thought and run with it there's no time to stop and correct your mistakes or else you'll lose the train of thought. However you do have to make sure that what you're saying is actually been translated right. So if there is confusion please ask so that I can clarify and understand but that may be the case for any confusion.

thank you for taking an interest in this project. I hope that this can be a beneficial project that helps move us forward and as such this would be Fork of HTML5/HTML Living Standard/Xhtml with an interest in no less than and interoperability with languages that Cole exist and are utilized by current HTML pages/PHP, etc., our goal here is to potential he create a fork of the current standard, Providing through a looser And perhaps more idealistic approach to a slew of potential ideas a different approach Emerges starting with I need to shut down and yet catalog any idea and I mean any idea that could be in fact added in or used for moving humanity forward through this language in this application in the real world. For this reason they will be I need perhaps to evaluate every addition that is proposed in the same way that the working groups of the W3C seem to run.  my intention is in fact to move this towards a proposal for acceptance as a standard language proposal for standardization as a language by the W3C and therefore the industry itself.

there will be more to follow.  I have included a copy of an SPKML document Being utilized hopefully at some point within the LPA-webApp Project Repository And that file is posted here in this repository as an example only. In that file Which has been purchased and includes not just a DTD portion as internally defining the tags set within(Which still is in need of definition of not only each tags' displayed default styling and lacks attribute definitions i'm sure) but also has a section of XSD(?) definition.This page has been pursed put requires further development to move it forward as well as the overall project and in some sense it does display in a browser but with nothing as far as anything but default or no definition so the styling it is rather plain

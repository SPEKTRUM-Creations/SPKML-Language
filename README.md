# SPKML-Language
You are invited to join this project in developing spkml as a language with the languages Starting point being a 15-year-old concept introduced in my book called CodeBase (by Chris Johnson/Christopher Johnson) that is being developed For real to be an answer to The creation of a median language That has the broad scope to be utilized at the network level as well as the system and user levels based on an XHTML Focused language which indeed can be interpreted or compiled within itself by itself utilizing a javascript core and encapsulating within single files multiple pages as well as the styling in CSS or even through the body of the SPKML tag set which is an extended superset of the HTML Current Living Standard.
